    "description": "What is Toastmasters? Toastmasters is an international organization with over 250,000 members worldwide consisting of almost 13,000 clubs in 106 countries. Since 2010, Malmö has had a Toastmasters club of its own, with meetings in English. What Does Toastmasters Do? Well, we have nothing to do with roasting bread or breakfast. Instead Toastmasters has grown to become a world leader in helping people become more competent and comfortable in front of an audience. Communications, public speaking and leadership skills can all be found in abundance at your normal Toastmasters meeting. Why Toastmasters? If you are in a position where you need to communicate, and who of us isn’t, Toastmasters can help. The self paced program, the members, and the global organization provide all the support you need to achieve whatever goal it is you have at a fraction of the cost of a normal one day communications course. From engineers to entertainers, government workers to entrepreneurs, Toastmasters members represent a wide range of people who are committed to working towards a common goal in a supportive, professional atmosphere. Plus, we are a lot of fun! Sounds Great! How do I get started? Of course it does! If you would like more information please check out our website at http://www.malmo.toastmasters.se/ or e-mail us at malmo@toastmasters.se . As a member organization, guests are always welcome to take a test drive before jumping in to what could be one of the most rewarding decisions you have ever made. Hope to see you soon at a Malmö Toastmasters meeting! Agenda: 17.45- Meet & Greet 18.00- Presentation 18.30- Meet & Eat 19.00- Q&A",

    "description": "Internet of Brain (IoB) is here: a global set of protocols and agreements will connect our brains to digital services online as well as to other brains, triggering the next communication revolution. Like it happened for Internet, the project has been prototyped by the army, some universities has been involved as well as some tech giants corporations. Also, a public proposal is underway. We will take a look at these projects from a architectural-design point of view and learn how do they work. We will take a look at the public proposal and talk about how to contribute and build together the best user-centered, privacy-aware, Internet of Brain.

    "description": "Welcome to another evening with learnings from real life cases using innovative Azure technologies! We have special guests that is everyday working with a really hot topics, Digital Transformation with DevOps and Infrastructure as code automation Session1:Enterprise digital transformation with Azure DevOps ServicesSharing main takeaways from migrating dozens of siloed software development lifecycles into one unified platform, implementing basic DevOps patterns to solve human resources and technical issues. It will be 50/50 about hard skills and soft skills. I will go into details with initial state evaluation, how to select a pilot migration project, what issues to expect, how not to get stuck in the middle of migration and keep on track with DevOps transformation in Enterprise with 30k+ employees.Sessions will also cover how Jira, Jenkins, qtest, teamcity, confluence were replaced by azure DevOps services. Session2:Cloud Infrastructure with C# and F#Modern cloud platforms offer amazing capabilities for application developers. However, cloud services are hard to manage without employing Infrastructure as Code tools for automation. Traditional tools like CloudFormation, ARM templates, and Terraform use text-based formats, which tend to be tedious, repetitive, and cumbersome to reuse. What if instead of configuration files, you could use your favourite programming languages like C# and F#? In this talk, Mikhail will introduce you to Pulumi, which uses actual code to manage infrastructure! See how you can bring your developer tools like code completion, types, components, and abstractions to cloud infrastructure definition. Speaker1:Speaker Yegor Lopatin, a cloud computing passionate IT engineer who is now helping people, helping people. Speaker has wide experience in implementing DevOps practices working outsourced, outstaffed, in-house employed; from East Europe to West Coast, and always having fun Twitter (@LopYeg): Speaker2:Mikhail Shilkov is a software developer at Pulumi, enabling developers and operators to work better together. Mikhail is a Microsoft Azure MVP, a Russian expat living in the Netherlands. He is passionate about the serverless mindset, leveraging the full variety of managed cloud services, and handling cloud infrastructure as code.

    "description": "We are fascinated by the idea of applying technology to create a better everyday life for the many people. Join us for our monthly IKEA Tech Meetup to learn more about the technologies that power IKEA behind the scenes to reach our 3+ billion annual visitors. You can expect a fun event full of learning, deep discussions and a lot of mingling, where we will share and learn from each other. And yes, there will be finger food and drinks – how else to mingle without it. DevOps and engineering practise were topics wished by our January meetup participants. We invited, therefore, two IKEA practitioners. Our first speaker is Albert Bertilsson. Albert is a senior product owner for Search with a passion for development and chocolate. He will speak about “Testing in production” and share, how a team reduced time to market, reduced risk to go to production and, as a bonus, got a system that can selfheal. Our second speaker is Daniel Grenner, who is a senior DevOps engineer in the Retail Range and Merchandising area. Daniel has a broad background within software development, including working as a Software Developer, Release Manager, Scrum Master and Service Manager. He loves to automate boring and repetitive tasks so that the team can spend time on the fun, creative and value-adding parts. Daniel will share experiences from introducing and improving DevOps practices in several teams in IKEA. He will also show a practical way forward if you want to do a similar thing in your teams. This can help you to start your DevOps journey, or find out what your next steps could be. We open the doors at 17.00 and at 17.30 the first session begins.The doors close at 20.45 - leaving you hopefully with great learning, new friends and curiosity to explore even more of IKEA technologies and challenges together. When this sounds interesting for you, be quick: RSVP your seat.The event is free of charge and tickets fly off fast. If you cannot make it, be fair. Please update your RSVP, so that someone else can join instead. We have space for ca. 60 curious people. Warm welcome! ",

It’s a language that takes a different approach to memory management. It has no garbage collector, yet leaves no leaks. Imagine a green and flowery garden! It grows and it shines with color in the sunlight. If the weeds are the memory leaks, how would you keep it tidy? Through planting the correct plants together and inviting some insects, or by hiring a gardener? Rust is a natural way of keeping the weeds out without the need for a garbage collector or gardener In this case. But what is Rust and why should we use it?

If you are not an entrepreneur, nor wanting to become one, you have no business in the dojo. Iteration through Build-Measure-Learn “Step one is to have a strong vision.

This shift requires new skills and new mindset from the testers when they no longer does the hands-on testing but instead guide the developers on how to think about good testing. So what does this actually mean for testers? What skills do we need to pickup or polish? Is this the future or just the latest buzz? We will go back to the Contest roots and do a classic style were anyone that wants does a 5min lightning talk about their experience or thoughts around the topic of coaching followed by facilitated discussions. The 5min talk doesn’t have to be something you share it can also be used to formulate a burning question you have.

    "description": "For teams and organizations moving towards a Continuous Delivery or Continuous Deployment model, automated tests are often the only gatekeeper before software is put into production. But can your automation be trusted enough to play this important role in the software development and delivery process? And what can you do to make sure your automation can be trusted enough to be relied on? In this talk, we'll take a look at trust and confidence with regards to test automation. You'll see a number of ways in which test automation can deceive you, why and how trust in test automation is lost and how to build tests you can trust on. We'll also take a closer look at mutation testing, a technique that can be used to verify that your automated (unit) tests actually do what they're supposed to do. In a live demo, you'll see what kind of information mutation testing can give you and how that compares to regularly used unit testing metrics like statement and branch coverage. You'll walk away from this talk with insights into what makes test automation reliable, how your test results can deceive you, as well as some practical tips on how to improve trust in your test automation.

    "description": "Ever wonder what you need to do to make your code run faster? Ever wondered how to become a “performance engineer”? Perhaps you do performance from time to time, in between one failure to the next severity 1 incident? And you have that strange feeling that you are doing it wrong? Perhaps you’ve never bothered to see how fast your code works. Or maybe it’s just difficult to admit that you don’t know how to improve your code? It has been known for centuries that this is always a database problem (or someone else’s problem) ;). During this presentation, you will learn how to become a programmer aware of the performance of your code. We will focus not only on tools like JMH. JFR and flamegraphs, but also on the process of optimizing performance. We will talk about how good quality, so-called “clean code” affects performance, why the data sets you use to benchmark your code are key to success, and when more does not mean faster.During the whole presentation, we will refactor and improve one, not-so-trivial example – something that all of us know, like and know how to implement.“Benchmark, profile, refactor, repeat” Speaker: Jarek Palka - Jarek has worked for more than 20 years in the IT industry, as a database administrator, programmer, architect, manager, and “onsite disaster engineer”. He has taken part in small, medium, and nonsensically-large projects using all different processes, including waterfall, agile and no process whatsoever, always with the same effect. This led him to the conclusion that it doesn’t matter what you do, as long as you do it in the simplest possible way, and use the right tools to do the work for you. Recently, he’s been spending too much time exploring JVM’s best kept secrets, reading about managed runtimes, parsers and interpreters, and writing his own virtual machine. From time to time, you can hear his low-quality jokes about architecture and programming at conferences in Poland. He is also the author of a blog, http://geekyprimitives.com/, and is one of the founders of the SegFault conferences brand as well as a full-time benchmarking infrastructure engineer at Neo4j.

    "description": "This workshop is a follow-up to the presentation delivered by Noah Schellenberg and Andrew Segar at FooCafe in January 2020. Time-to-Event (TtE) Analytics is an especially important concept when performing survival analysis. The unique aspect of TtE Analytics is the use of the suspensions or right-censored data. We will review key messages from the talk in January and together work through the examples and exercises in R and Stan. There will be time for questions and discussions at the end of the workshop session. The workshop is aiming the users with an intermediate level of R proficiency. Basic familiarity with Bayesian methods and probabilistic modelling is encouraged, but not strictly required. About the Speakers: Noah Schellenberg is a Manager in the newly developed Data Science Center of Excellence at Tetra Pak. Previously he held positions as a Lead Data Scientist at Think Big Analytics, a Teradata Company and Principle Expert Engineer at Siemens Wind Power. Andrew Segar is a Data Scientist at Tetra Pak with expertise in TtE Analytics using R. This event is co-hosted with FooCafe, Malmö. Please RSVP your spot here: ",
